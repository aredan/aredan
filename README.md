- I love Technology and my interest are mainly Servers and Networking, better if I have to deal with both!!
- Doing a lot of Kubernetes (k3s - RKE2) and trying to get onboard with CI/CD stuff.
- Still loving infra!!! Ansible and Terraform, dont forget my old friend vCenter :)
- vSphere is my hypervisor of choice!
