### Hey There!

- I love Technology and my interest are mainly Servers and Networking, better if I have to deal with both!!
- Doing a lot of Kubernetes (k3s - RKE2 - OpenShift) and trying to get onboard with CI/CD stuff.
- Still loving infra!!! Ansible and Terraform.  :)
- Moving my Virtualization needs to Harvester HCI, wanting to build a Private Cloud!
- Operating [AS207036](https://bgp.he.net/AS207036) & [AS28045](https://bgp.he.net/AS28045) for aaNetworks infra (https://aanetworks.org), for fun!
